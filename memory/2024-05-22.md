## New Workflow: OpenClaw + OpenCode + GitHub + Vercel

### User Request
The user requested to adopt a new, more advanced AI-driven development workflow using:
- **OpenClaw (Antigravity):** As the orchestrating AI agent.
- **OpenCode:** For automated code generation, modification, and management.
- **GitHub:** For code hosting, version control, and collaboration.
- **Vercel:** For automated deployment and hosting.

This workflow aims to allow the AI agent to write code, manage versions, and auto-deploy without direct user intervention in the code.

### Agent's Understanding and Plan
Antigravity acknowledges the new workflow and understands its role as the coordinator. The plan is to:
1.  **Stop manual code edits:** Transition from direct edits to leveraging OpenCode for all code changes, starting with `katago_analyzer.py`.
2.  **Initialize GitHub:** Prepare to push the project to a GitHub repository, requiring the user to specify a repository name.
3.  **Explore Vercel deployment:** Understand the user's needs for Vercel deployment (e.g., web interface for analysis, API hosting) for the KataGo project.

### Information Needed from User
To proceed with the new workflow, Antigravity requires the following information:
1.  **GitHub Repository Name:** The desired name for the GitHub repository.
2.  **Vercel Deployment Needs:** Clarification on how Vercel should be used for the KataGo project (e.g., hosting a web UI, an API, or if it's not needed for deployment).
3.  **OpenCode Access/Configuration:** Details on how OpenCode is integrated or accessed (e.g., direct API call, API Key, specific command).

### Current Task Status
The previous task of manually modifying `katago_analyzer.py` is superseded by the new workflow, where OpenCode will handle the code generation. The focus is now on setting up the infrastructure for the new workflow.
